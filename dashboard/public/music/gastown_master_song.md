# Gas Town: The Complete Guide
## A Master Song Covering All Aspects of Gastown

---

## Location Flexibility

**Gastown can be set up anywhere in your file system** that is accessible by Arena. This is by design - you're not limited to any specific directory structure. As long as:

1. The path is accessible via the mounted volumes in Arena
2. Your project contains the appropriate `.beads/` directory structure
3. The beads viewer can read from that location

You can have multiple Gastown instances, each managing different projects or workflows. The Arena dashboard's Beads tab can point to any of these locations.

### Lyrics

```
[PART I: WELCOME & WARNING]

[Verse 1 - The Ladder]
Eight stages on the ladder, where do you stand?
Zero AI, completions in your hand
Sidebar agent asking permission to run
YOLO mode engaged, now the real fun's begun
CLI single agent, diffs scroll by
Multi-agent chaos, three to five
Seven plus you're pushing, hand-managing the swarm
Eight means you're building, weathering the storm

[Chorus - Welcome]
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Twenty chimps on the factory floor
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Superintelligent, ripping through code

[Verse 2 - The Warning]
You're not ready yet, I'm warning you now
Fish fall from barrels, some escape somehow
Throughput is the mission, creation at the speed of thought
Physics over politeness, that's what we've been taught
Expensive as hell, cash guzzler supreme
Multiple accounts to feed the machine
If you care about money, get out of here
Gas Town ain't safe, that much is clear

---

[PART II: THE ROLES]

[Verse 3 - Mayor]
Mayor's your concierge, chief of staff
gt may at, attach to the throne
Kick off convoys, you're never alone
Talk to them first, they'll clear your path
Mayor-only mode, that's the tutorial
Learn Gas Town, nothing but practical

[Verse 4 - The Crew]
Crew are your named, long-lived friends
Design work and back-and-forth, it never ends
C-b n and p to cycle through
Seven per rig, maybe eight'll do
Theme their names so you know the state
Gas Town crew on the left in blue

[Chorus - The Seven]
Seven roles spinning in the machine
Mayor, Polecats, Refinery
Witness, Deacon, Dogs, and Crew
Overseer's the eighth, and that one's you

[Verse 5 - Polecats]
Polecats spin up on demand
Ephemeral workers across the land
Submit their MRs, then they disappear
Names get recycled, have no fear
Not a pool, they don't sit idle
Clock out and leave, that's the cycle

[Verse 6 - Support Roles]
Refinery handles the merge queue fight
One at a time, getting it right
Witness watches over the swarm
Keeps polecats working, weathers the storm
Deacon's the daemon beacon patrol
Pings every minute, keeping control

---

[PART III: THE WORKFLOW - GUPP]

[Verse 7 - GUPP]
Work on your hook, you must run it
No exceptions, no excuses, just begun it
Session dies, another one's coming
GUPP keeps the whole damn engine humming
Agent is a bead, identity in Git
Sessions are the cattle, throw them at it

[Chorus - Keep It Moving]
GUPP! Keep it moving!
Nondeterministic but we get it done
GUPP! Keep it moving!
Throw agents at it till the work is won

[Verse 8 - The Hook]
Hook is where you hang your molecules
Persistent through crashes, those are the rules
Sometimes they're polite, sitting there waiting
Nudge them awake, no hesitating
Thirty to sixty seconds, they get the poke
Physics over politeness, that's no joke

---

[PART IV: THE MEOW STACK]

[Verse 9 - Beads]
bd create - file a new bead
bd show - see what you need
Rig beads for project work
Town beads where orchestration lurks
Atomic units, watch them go
Git-backed data, run the show

[Verse 10 - The Stack]
Molecular Expression Of Work
That's the stack where agents lurk
Beads at the bottom, atomic units
Epics with children, parallel pursuits
Molecules are workflows chained
Complex shapes, loops contained

[Chorus - MEOW]
MEOW stack, MEOW stack
Everything you need to attack
Wisps are vapor, ephemeral phase
Formulas cook down, that's the craze
Guzzoline - the sea of work
Molecular chemistry where agents lurk

---

[PART V: CONVOYS & WORK]

[Verse 11 - Convoy]
Everything rolls up into a Convoy
Ticketing system, deploy deploy deploy
gt sling the work, watch it fly
Features landing under the sky
Wrap your beads in a tracking unit
Convoy dashboard shows what's in it

[Chorus - Rolling]
Convoy rolling, convoy rolling
Sling the work and watch it go
Multiple swarms can attack one convoy
Recycling polecats, deploy deploy

[Verse 12 - Crew Cycling]
Don't watch your agents work
That's not how this goes
Give them tasks then leave them be
Read when the output shows
Like you're Jeff Bezos getting briefed
One by one they report

---

[PART VI: TOOLS & COMMANDS]

[Verse 13 - tmux Basics]
C-b s, list your sessions
Snoop around, learn your lessons
C-b n, next in the group
C-b p, previous loop
C-b bracket left, that's copy mode
Pause the output, scroll the road

[Chorus - tmux]
tmux, tmux, learn it well
A few commands and you'll excel
tmux, tmux, stays out of your way
Saves your ass every single day

[Verse 14 - gt Commands]
gt sling - throw work to workers
gt handoff - recycle the session
gt nudge - poke the workers awake
gt seance - talk to the dead
gt ready - town-level view
gt crew add - spawn a new friend

[Bridge - Commands]
gt commands in your hands
Power tools across the lands
Shell out with bang to save the cost
Mechanical handoff, nothing lost

---

[PART VII: THE HANDOFF]

[Verse 15 - Handoff]
Context fills up, session runs dry
Time to hand off, kiss it goodbye
"Let's hand off" - magic words to say
Worker cleans up, starts a new day
Three ways to do it, pick your style
Bang gt handoff - mechanical, no toll

[Chorus - Handoff]
Handoff, handoff, let it go
Session dies but the work still flows
Hook survives, work survives
Beads in Git, the ledger thrives
Hand it off, hand it off

[Verse 16 - Continuity]
Session died mid-task, context gone
But the work continues on
gt seance, call them back
Resume the old session track
Predecessor hands off the pile
Successor picks up in style

---

[PART VIII: THE SWARM]

[Verse 17 - Polecat Swarm]
Ephemeral workers, spin up on demand
Well-defined beads, fully spec'd out
Polecats thrive, that's what it's about
Fish flying into barrels at the docks
Some fall out, more fish coming
Throughput is king, efficiency's humming

[Chorus - Swarm]
Swarm! Polecat swarm!
Twelve to thirty workers in the storm
Submit your MRs, that's the norm
Chaotic and sloppy, that's the game
Bugs get fixed twice, pick the winner's name

[Verse 18 - Refinery]
Monkey knife fight over rebasing
Baseline changes while you're chasing
Refinery's job: intelligent merging
One at a time, carefully surging
Through the Refinery, one by one
No work gets lost until it's done

---

[PART IX: OPERATIONS]

[Verse 19 - PR Sheriff]
Permanent hook on the crew
bd-pr-sheriff, standing orders true
Every session startup, check the PRs
Sling the easy ones to other crew
Boot up your crew, they auto-merge
Five PRs gone in the first surge

[Verse 20 - Night Shift]
Feed the machine before you sleep
Convoys queued up, running deep
Polecats swarming through the night
Wake up to PRs merged just right
Twelve hours later, check the feed
Landed convoys, fulfilled the need

[Chorus - Night Shift]
Night shift, night shift
Gas Town never sleeps
While the world counts sheep
Bank account a little lighter
But your codebase so much tighter

---

[PART X: DANGERS & HERESIES]

[Verse 21 - Heresies]
Garden's invisible, you can't see the code
Hundreds of thousands of lines in the road
Heresies spread when you're coding blind
Wrong beliefs sneaking, infecting the mind
"Idle polecats" - there's no such thing
They vanish when done, they don't hang and swing

[Chorus - Heresies]
Heresies, heresies
Spreading through the codebase like a disease
Capture your principles in the priming
Point to the principle they violate
Eradicate before it's too late

[Verse 22 - The Murder Mystery]
Something's wrong in Gas Town tonight
Workers dying, not by right
Like a game of Clue it went
Who killed the workers? Investigation spent
The Deacon did it, every minute
Cleaning up "stale" workers - but they weren't stale

---

[FINALE: THE PROMISE]

[Verse 23 - NDI]
The path is nondeterministic
But the outcome? Guaranteed
Keep throwing sessions at the problem
Eventually you will succeed
Discovery over tracking
MEOW stack, never stop attacking

[Verse 24 - The Dream]
From your town root, run the commands
Orchestrate workers across the lands
Works all night while you sleep
Promises it keeps
Every fix makes the engine stronger
Gas Town runs a little longer

[Final Chorus - Welcome Home]
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Robot chimps that will wreck your shit
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Are you crazy enough? Then this is it!

Convoy landed, work is done
Another victory, another one
Gas Town worked while you were dreaming
Code shipping, progress streaming

[Outro]
GUPP! Keep it moving!
MEOW stack running strong
Convoy rolling, rolling, rolling
This is where you belong

Welcome to Gas Town
```
