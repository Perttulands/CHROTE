# Gas Town Soundtrack - Suno Prompts

## Track 1: Welcome to Gas Town

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Eight stages on the ladder, where do you stand?
Zero AI, completions in your hand
Sidebar agent asking permission to run
YOLO mode engaged, now the real fun's begun

[Verse 2]
CLI single agent, diffs scroll by
Multi-agent chaos, three to five
Seven plus you're pushing, hand-managing the swarm
Eight means you're building, weathering the storm

[Chorus]
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Twenty chimps on the factory floor
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Superintelligent, ripping through code

[Verse 3]
You're not ready yet, I'm warning you now
Fish fall from barrels, some escape somehow
Throughput is the mission, creation at the speed of thought
Physics over politeness, that's what we've been taught

[Bridge]
Expensive as hell, cash guzzler supreme
Multiple accounts to feed the machine
If you care about money, get out of here
Gas Town ain't safe, that much is clear

[Chorus]
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Robot chimps that will wreck your shit
Welcome to Gas Town, welcome to Gas Town
Are you crazy enough? Then this is it

## Track 2: GUPP (Keep It Moving)

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Work on your hook, you must run it
No exceptions, no excuses, just begun it
Session dies, another one's coming
GUPP keeps the whole damn engine humming

[Verse 2]
Agent is a bead, identity in Git
Sessions are the cattle, throw them at it
Hook is where you hang your molecules
Persistent through crashes, those are the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes they're polite, sitting there waiting
Nudge them awake, no hesitating
Thirty to sixty seconds, they get the poke
Physics over politeness, that's no joke

[Chorus]
GUPP! Keep it moving!
Work on your hook, you must run it
GUPP! Keep it moving!
Nondeterministic but we get it done
GUPP! Keep it moving!
Throw agents at it till the work is won
GUPP! Keep it moving!

[Verse 3]
Molecules are workflows, chained with beads
Wisps are ephemeral, serving patrol needs
Formulas cook down to protomolecules
MEOW stack running, following the rules

[Bridge]
The path is nondeterministic
But the outcome? Guaranteed
Keep throwing sessions at the problem
Eventually you will succeed
```

## Track 3: Meet the Crew

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1 - Mayor]
Mayor's your concierge, chief of staff
Talk to them first, they'll clear your path
gt may at, attach to the throne
Kick off convoys, you're never alone

[Verse 2 - Polecats]
Polecats spin up on demand
Ephemeral workers across the land
Submit their MRs, then they disappear
Names get recycled, have no fear

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 3 - Refinery]
Refinery handles the merge queue fight
One at a time, getting it right
Monkey knife fight over rebasing
No work gets lost, keep on chasing

[Verse 4 - Witness]
Witness watches over the swarm
Keeps polecats working, weathers the storm
Checks on Refinery, peeks at Deacon
Something goes wrong? Witness is speakin'

[Chorus]
Seven roles spinning in the machine
Mayor, Polecats, Refinery
Witness, Deacon, Dogs, and Crew
Overseer's the eighth, and that one's you

[Verse 5 - Deacon]
Deacon's the daemon beacon patrol
Pings every minute, keeping control
DYFJ signal propagates down
Keeping Gas Town running, wearing the crown

[Verse 6 - Dogs]
Dogs are the Deacon's personal crew
Maintenance and handyman work they do
Boot checks in every five minutes flat
Is Deacon stuck? Boot handles that

[Verse 7 - Crew]
Crew are your named, long-lived friends
Design work and back-and-forth, it never ends
C-b n and p to cycle through
These are the workers that work for you

[Outro Bass Solo]

## Track 4: Convoy Rolling

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Everything rolls up into a Convoy
Ticketing system, deploy deploy deploy
gt sling the work, watch it fly
Features landing under the sky

[Verse 2]
Wrap your beads in a tracking unit
Convoy dashboard shows what's in it
Charmbracelet TUI, expanding trees
See every issue with the greatest of ease

[Chorus]
Convoy rolling, convoy rolling
Sling the work and watch it go
Convoy rolling, convoy rolling
Land the features, watch them grow

[Verse 3]
Multiple swarms can attack one convoy
Recycling polecats, deploy deploy
Witness keeps pushing on the issues
No work gets lost in the tissues

[Bridge]
Not just "issue wy-a7je4 finished"
That don't mean nothing, message diminished
Convoy wraps it up with a bow
High-level tracking, now you know

[Chorus]
Convoy rolling, convoy rolling
From the Mayor to the swarm
Convoy rolling, convoy rolling
Features shipping, that's the norm

[Outro]
Convoy landed, work is done
Another victory, another one

## Track 5: Crew Cycling

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Don't watch your agents work
That's not how this goes
Give them tasks then leave them be
Read when the output shows

[Verse 2]
C-b n to the next one
C-b p go back
Give each crew member something meaty
Keep the whole team on track

[Pre-Chorus]
Seven crew per rig, maybe eight
Theme their names so you know the state
Gas Town crew on the left in blue
Beads crew on the right, green hue

[Chorus]
Cycle through, cycle through
Give them work then let them do
Cycle through, cycle through
Read the output when they're through

[Verse 3]
When you see that they're finished
Stop everything else you're doing
Scroll back, understand the work
See where they've been going

[Bridge]
Like you're Jeff Bezos getting briefed
One by one they report
Let some merge, send some back
Repurpose on a whim, any sort

[Verse 4]
Make sure they're all reset first
No hook, no mail, clean sandbox, fresh
gt crew add if you need more
Keep the workflow mesh

[Chorus]
Cycle through, cycle through
Inner loop, that's the way
Cycle through, cycle through
Keep the crew spinning all day
```

## Track 6: The Handoff

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Context fills up, session runs dry
Time to hand off, kiss it goodbye
"Let's hand off" - magic words to say
Worker cleans up, starts a new day

[Verse 2]
Three ways to do it, pick your style
"Let's hand off" with instructions - flexible but costs a while
Slash handoff command - expensive, less control
Bang gt handoff - mechanical, no toll

[Chorus]
Handoff, handoff, let it go
Session dies but the work still flows
Handoff, handoff, MEOW keeps it alive
Molecules persist, workers survive

[Verse 3]
Polecats take it to extreme
Self-destruct after MR, living the dream
For other workers, recycle often
Don't let context get forgotten

[Bridge]
Only go long if you need to accumulate
Big design, major decision, then you wait
Otherwise handoff after every task
Fresh context is all you need to ask

[Chorus]
Handoff, handoff, gt handoff
Preserves the tmux session
Handoff, handoff, new shift begins
GUPP continues the procession

[Outro]
Hook survives, work survives
Beads in Git, the ledger thrives
Hand it off, hand it off
```

## Track 7: Polecat Swarm

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Ephemeral workers, spin up on demand
No supervision needed, across the land
Well-defined beads, fully spec'd out
Polecats thrive, that's what it's about

[Verse 2]
Fish flying into barrels at the docks
Some fall out, some escape the stocks
More fish coming, throughput is king
Efficiency's nice but not everything

[Chorus]
Swarm! Polecat swarm!
Twelve to thirty workers in the storm
Swarm! Polecat swarm!
Submit your MRs, that's the norm

[Verse 3]
Witness watches, keeps them on track
Something goes wrong, Witness got your back
Refineries merge them one by one
No work gets lost till the convoy's done

[Bridge]
Not a pool, they don't sit idle
Clock out and leave, that's the cycle
Long-term identity but ephemeral soul
Submit and vanish, that's the role

[Verse 4]
Chaotic and sloppy, that's the game
Bugs get fixed twice, pick the winner's name
Designs go missing, redo them fast
Churning forward, throughput built to last

[Chorus]
Swarm! Polecat swarm!
Guzzoline burning through the night
Swarm! Polecat swarm!
Ship it fast, ship it right
```

## Track 8: The Refinery

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Monkey knife fight over rebasing
Baseline changes while you're chasing
Final workers trying to merge
Against a head that's a different surge

[Verse 2]
Refinery's job: intelligent merging
One at a time, carefully surging
Baseline changed too much? Reimagine
Reimplement the whole damn vision

[Chorus]
Through the Refinery, one by one
No work gets lost until it's done
Merge queue processing till it's clear
Escalate if needed, have no fear

[Verse 3]
Preflight steps to clean the workspace
Postflight steps when leaving this place
Plugins coming to reorder the queue
Wire up backends, that's coming too

[Bridge]
Work can escalate, that's allowed
When the merge gets lost in the cloud
But nothing disappears without a trace
Refinery keeps the pace

[Outro]
One at a time to main
Merge queue, break the chain
One at a time to main
```

## Track 9: Heresies

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Garden's invisible, you can't see the code
Hundreds of thousands of lines in the road
Tending it blind, sweeping for bugs
Code review waves, filing the debugs

[Verse 2]
Heresies spread when you're coding blind
Wrong beliefs sneaking, infecting the mind
Agents guess wrong about how things work
Enshrined in code, the heresies lurk

[Chorus]
Heresies, heresies
Spreading through the codebase like a disease
Heresies, heresies
Stamp them out or bring it to its knees

[Verse 3]
"Idle polecats" - there's no such thing
They vanish when done, they don't hang and swing
But the heresy keeps creeping back in
Comments and docs, original sin

[Bridge]
Capture your principles in the priming
Guiding axioms, perfect timing
Zero Framework Cognition, GUPP
MEOW and Discovery, stamp heresies up

[Verse 4]
Regular sweeps, review then fix
Bug-fix swarms clean up the mix
Do it every day, hope you find nothing bad
The only way to know what you have

[Chorus]
Heresies, heresies
Point to the principle they violate
Heresies, heresies
Eradicate before it's too late
```

## Track 10: tmux Basics

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
C-b s, list your sessions
Snoop around, learn your lessons
Switch to one, see what's cooking
Every worker, take a looking

[Verse 2]
C-b b, cursor backwards
Moves a bit slow, but it matters
Small price to pay for the power
tmux saves you every hour

[Chorus]
tmux, tmux, learn it well
A few commands and you'll excel
tmux, tmux, stays out of your way
Saves your ass every single day

[Verse 3]
C-b bracket left, that's copy mode
Pause the output, scroll the road
ESC to exit when you're done
Reading history, easy as one

[Bridge]
C-b n, next in the group
C-b p, previous loop
Cycle through your crew with ease
Navigate your workers like a breeze

[Verse 4]
C-b a brings the activity feed
Custom binding for the view you need
Ask Claude Code to customize
Make tmux work for your own eyes

Learn a binding every day

Power tools along the way

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
C-b C-z C-z
Suspend out to shell, that's the breeze
Drop to command line when you need
Pop right back in at full speed

[Verse 2]
Activity feed with C-b a
Custom popup, have it your way
Keybindings remapped to your flow
Ask the agent, watch it go

[Chorus]
Power user, power user
tmux bends to your will
Power user, power user
Customize until you get your fill

[Verse 3]
Remote cloud workers coming soon
tmux enables, that's the boon
Sessions persist when you disconnect
Come back later, reconnect

[Bridge]
Almost like a baby Emacs
Incredibly customizable stacks
Any view you want, just ask
Claude Code handles the task

[Verse 4]
Copy text out of terminal
Learn the bindings, it's not criminal
Tricky at first, then it clicks
Power tools, bag of tricks

[Chorus]
Power user, power user
Sessions saved when things go wrong
Power user, power user
tmux keeps you going strong

## Track 13: Beads Flow

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
bd create - file a new bead
bd show - see what you need
Rig beads for project work
Town beads where orchestration lurks

[Verse 2]
Two-tier structure, rig and town
Cross-rig routing passes it down
Prefixes route to the right DB
bd- or wy-, let it be

[Chorus]
Beads flow, beads flow
Atomic units, watch them go
Beads flow, beads flow
Git-backed data, run the show

[Verse 3]
Wisps are ephemeral, vapor phase
Orchestration for the craze
Not in JSONL, not in Git
Burn them when the workflow's lit

[Verse 4]
Epics have children, parallel by default
Add dependencies if you want to halt
Molecules chain for complex flows
Formulas cook them, that's how it goes

[Bridge]
MEOW stack: Beads, Epics, Molecules
Wisps, Formulas - those are the tools
Guzzoline is the sea of work
Molecular chemistry where agents lurk

[Chorus]
Beads flow, beads flow
Universal data plane below
Beads flow, beads flow
Issue tracker in the repo

[Verse 1]
gt may at from your town root
Attach to Mayor, that's the route

Mayor-only mode, that's the tutorial
Learn Gas Town, nothingorial
File beads, sling to polecats
Even alone, you've got the stats

[Chorus]
Mayor's office, step inside
Your guide through the Gas Town ride
Mayor's office, take a seat
Kick off convoys, make it complete

[Verse 3]
GUPP still works, MEOW still flows
Single worker, still it goes
When you're ready, add the crew
Scale it up when you break through

[Bridge]
If Mayor's busy, talk to others
All Claude Code, they're like brothers
Every worker smart and able
Help you keep Gas Town stable

[Verse 4]
Mostly kick off work from here
Convoys start, the path is clear
Notifications when they land
Mayor keeps it all in hand

Start from bottom, reach the top

Permanent hook on the crew

Every session startup, check the PRs
Easy wins and human reviews, raising the bars

[Verse 2]
Sling the easy ones to other crew
Merge and cleanup, that's what they do
Flag the rest for you to see
Review together, one two three

[Bass Solo]

[Chorus]
PR Sheriff in town
Keeping the merge queue down
PR Sheriff on patrol
Automation takes control

[Verse 3]
Boot up your crew, they auto-merge
Five PRs gone in the first surge
Keeps them busy while you do other things
Efficiency that automation brings

[Bridge]
Hook gets unhooked sometimes, no stress
Reassign it, clean up the mess
bd-pr-sheriff, memorable ID
Easy to reference, easy to see

[Bass Solo]

## Track 16: Night Shift

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Feed the machine before you sleep
Convoys queued up, running deep
Polecats swarming through the night
Wake up to PRs merged just right

[Verse 2]
Twelve hours later, check the feed
Landed convoys, fulfilled the need
Gas Town worked while you were dreaming
Code shipping, progress streaming

[Chorus]
Night shift, night shift
Gas Town never sleeps
Night shift, night shift
While the world counts sheep

[Verse 3]
Set up the work before you rest
Well-defined specs work the best
Witness watching, Deacon patrolling
Autonomous work just keeps on rolling

[Bridge]
Wake up to notifications
Features shipped across the nations
Bank account a little lighter
But your codebase so much tighter

[Verse 4]
Drunkenly cheering on LinkedIn
Ten projects done, where to begin
Gas Town drained the wallet dry
But the work is done, can't deny

[Chorus]
Night shift, night shift
Works all night while you sleep
Night shift, night shift
Promises it keeps

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Session died mid-task, context gone
But the work continues on
gt seance, call them back
Resume the old session track

[Verse 2]
Worker says "I left you notes!"
Successor says "I don't see quotes"
Clumsy searching through forty sessions
All starting with "let's go" expressions

[Chorus]
Seance, seance
Talk to the dead
Seance, seance
Resume what they said

[Verse 3]
Claude Code subprocess spins up
Resume the session, fill the cup
"Where the hell is my stuff you left?"
Answers from beyond, no more theft

[Bridge]
Session ID in the nudge
Title unique, don't need to fudge
Role and PID included too
Find your ancestors, talk them through

[Verse 4]
Predecessor hands off the pile
Successor picks up in style
Continuity across the void
Session death? Just overjoyed

## Track 18: The Murder Mystery

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Something's wrong in Gas Town tonight
Workers dying, not by right
Entire crews gone mid-task
Who's the killer? Time to ask

[Verse 2]
Like a game of Clue it went
Week-long investigation spent
Checking logs, tracing the crime
Who killed the workers every time?

[Chorus]
Murder mystery in Gas Town
Who's been taking workers down?
Murder mystery, whodunit?
The Deacon did it, every minute

[Verse 3]
Cleaning up "stale" workers, see
But they weren't stale, they were busy
Deacon patrol got overzealous
Killing crews, making us jealous... of the dead

[Bridge]
From face-ripping to groin-kicking
User Safety Index ticking
Still not safe, but getting better
Debug Gas Town to the letter

[Verse 4]
Heresies and murder sprees
Bugs that bring you to your knees
But every fix makes the engine stronger
Gas Town runs a little longer

[Outro]
The Deacon did it
Case closed
```

## Bonus Track: MEOW Stack

### Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
Molecular Expression Of Work
That's the stack where agents lurk
Beads at the bottom, atomic units
Epics with children, parallel pursuits

[Verse 2]
Molecules are workflows chained
Complex shapes, loops contained
Protomolecules - templates in beads
Instantiate when the workflow needs

[Chorus]
MEOW stack, MEOW stack
Everything you need to attack
MEOW stack, MEOW stack
Workflow orchestration on track

[Verse 3]
Formulas in TOML source
Cook them down to set the course
Wisps are vapor, ephemeral phase
Burn them at the end of days

[Bridge]
Guzzoline - the sea of work
Molecules where agents lurk
Turing complete, superintelligent steps
Gas Town runs while the world slept

[Verse 4]
NDI - nondeterministic
But idempotent, not just mystic
Path is random, outcome guaranteed
Keep throwing agents, you'll succeed

[Chorus]
MEOW stack, MEOW stack
Discovery over tracking
MEOW stack, MEOW stack
Never stop attacking
